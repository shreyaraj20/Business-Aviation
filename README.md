I have used CSS to do the styling of my website. To develop this, I have created a folder for all the CSS files used in the project. For each section on the website like Header, Footer, Inventory, Special, News, Logo, etc, I have created nine different CSS files. I have created separate files for each section to ensure that the code is clean and easy to understand. I have mainly used FLEX to create each section and make it a responsive website.
